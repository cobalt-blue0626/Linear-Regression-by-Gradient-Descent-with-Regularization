# Linear-Regression-by-Gradient-Descent-with-Regularization
This homework consists of three parts. 
First, your task is to implement regularized linear regression to predict the amount of water flowing out of a dam using the change of water level in a reservoir.

Second, you will go through some diagnostics of debugging learning algorithms and examine theeffects of underfitting vs. overfitting.

Third, The problem with our linear model was that it was too simple for the data and led to underfitting. In this part, you will address this problem by adding more features.
